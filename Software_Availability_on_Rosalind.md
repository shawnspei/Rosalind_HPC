# Software Available

Rosalind has many of the widely used programming/scripting languages and tools already pre-installed. Some of these languages are globally installed and ready for use, while others may need to be loaded as modules or as a node request before the language can be used.

##  Global Installs
These language can be used similarly to how one would use them on their local device.  They are globally available to all users anywhere they may navigate within their group(s) on Rosalind.

## Module Loads
These languages are availabe for use after the user has called `module load` followed by the module they would like to install.  To load a particular version of one these language, please check `module avail` to find the full module name. Using `module load python` defaults to version 2.7 and using `module load R` default to version 3.4 
1.  R-3.3.1
2.  Python 2.7/3.5

## Node Installs
These languages are restricted to particular set of nodes on Rosalind.  Due to licensing restrictions, only a subset of nodes have these languages installed on them.
